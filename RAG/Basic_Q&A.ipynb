INTRODUCTION\\nA. MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND\\nAgentic AIs constitute a qualitative leap in the development\\nof artificial intelligence, defined by their capability to set\\ncomplex goals in a changing and uncontrolled situation\\nand to pursue them through autonomously managing their\\nresources. Most AI systems, however, were built and operated\\nas tools under supervision with restrictions and definitions\\nprovided. These systems are good at doing well-defined tasks\\nwithin certain boundaries but prominently fail whenever the\\nattempted tasks have no end-state or specific parameters to\\nmanipulate. Whereas Agentic AIs can be low-level operative,\\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\\napproving it for publication was Filbert Juwono\\n.\\ni.e., goal-directed, even in situations where there are drastic\\nchanges and multiple such goals to toggle between.\\nOne of the factors that motivated the design of Agentic AIs\\nis the necessity for tools designed to be able to operate in bet-\\nter yet complex real-world conditions with significant room\\nfor flexibility. For example, in disaster relief, healthcare, and\\ncyber security, where proper decisions are needed and the\\nchaos is considerable, the ability to control a situation inde-\\npendently is critical. Agentic AIs don’t just assist in human\\naction; they enhance it while taking on tasks that demand\\nhigh involvement and multi-tasking without constant human\\nintervention. Such a paradigm shift promises to expand the\\ntarget area of AI from being passive and reactive to focusing\\non strategic planning, information processing, and problem-\\nsolving, enabling a new era once the rights conditions\\nare met.\\n18912\\n\\n 2025 The Authors.

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nThe impact of Agentic AI [1], [2], [3] on society is likely to\\nbe considerable. As AI becomes embedded in more and more\\ncore systems and industries, agentic AI systems would be\\nable to work side by side with humans and take on tasks that\\ncan reallocate human effort, increase productivity, and engage\\nin situations where human presence may be undesirable or\\ndangerous. This change could transform job structures in\\nsectors, allowing for working in concert where AIs perform\\noperational tasks and people deal with more complex and\\nstrategic roles.\\nB. DEFINITION AND SCOPE\\nIn this sense, Agentic AI includes the class of autonomous AI\\nsystems [4] that undertake to finish a set of complex tasks that\\nspan over long periods of time without human supervision.\\nIt learns context and makes decisions. Such systems are\\ndesigned to operate with a certain level of autonomy, allowing\\nthem to traverse changing settings, deal with unexpected\\nsituations, and optimize performance over time. Tying them\\ntogether are the features of autonomy and adaptiveness to\\ncope with task-oriented processes. Unlike classic AI [5],\\nwhich is rule-based and requires instructions to be performed,\\nand generative AI, which patterns and generates an image,\\nAgentic AI features the best of both worlds.\\nIt is valuable to place agentic AI alongside current AI\\nparadigms to put its boundaries into perspective. For example,\\nclassical AI was never focused on image recognition or\\nlanguage translations [6], [7] but instead aimed at achieving\\nvery narrow goals.\\nThe first is how Generative AI [8] works. In reverse\\noperations, it combines pieces of information learned through\\nnumbers and creates content, such as words or images.\\nOn the other hand, Agentic AI surpasses the former two\\napproaches with goal-oriented, input-formed, and adaptable\\ncharacteristics that allow it to accomplish intricate and multi-\\nlayered tasks in a period without needing a set of instructions\\neach time.\\nAt this point of the survey, the focus is on why someone\\nshould be interested in Agentic AI. From its structural\\nand operational characteristics, why is it based on goals,\\nand how can that advanced type of AI be applied in\\nvarious fields where its application is unique? In addition,\\nthis article also looks into the various practical and moral\\nissues that arise from using systems based on such AI and\\ndiscusses approaches that deal with safety, transparency, and\\naccountability. The provided definition of Agentic AI allows\\nthe authors of this survey to discuss precisely what features\\nof this type of AI system distinguish it from others and aid in\\nits effective and integrated analysis.\\nC. OBJECTIVES AND CONTRIBUTIONS\\nThis survey paper aims to provide an extensive collection of\\nAgentic AI knowledge and set its boundaries for easier under-\\nstanding by a wider audience of researchers, developers, and\\npolicy-makers. Key contributions of this survey include:\\n• A systematic review of the main elements that comprise\\nAgentic AI systems with an emphasis on how these\\nsystems differ from other commonsense and generative\\nAI systems.\\n• A comprehensive study of the techniques and concepts\\nused in constructing and assessing Agentic AI, including\\nthe architectures, learning approaches, and training\\nmethods.\\n• The current and potential uses in different areas,\\nincluding practical examples of the effectiveness of\\nAgentic AI applications in practice.\\n• Highlighting engineering problems but not limited to\\nthese: goal design and convergence, context adaptation,\\nand limited resources.\\n• A considers the ethical, societal, and regulatory issues\\nwith adopting Agentic AI, including relevant concerns\\nof responsibility, equity, and transparency.\\n• Recommendations towards future research, advancing\\nsuggestions on how the issues of scale, context, and\\nethics are best integrated into the implementation of\\nAgentic AI.\\nThis paper’s expected contributions are more than simply a\\nliterature review; rather, they should offer a useful and well-\\norganized background to develop the issues and particulars\\nof Agentic AI. This paper aims to provide important insights\\ninto managing operational practices and technological solu-\\ntions that promote and sustain the development of ethical\\nagentic AI systems.\\nD.

FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS\\nA. AGENTIC AI AND ITS ROLE IN THE AI ECOSYSTEM\\nWithin the AI field, Agentic AI serves as a different form\\nof intelligence that can take more autonomously functioning\\nagentic behaviors that are not limited to performing specific\\ntasks or following content-generating algorithms. When\\nviewed in an ecosystem context, Agentic AI stands out\\nbecause of its purpose, flexibility, and behavior, which\\nenables such AIs to operate almost independently. Rather\\nthan following strict guidelines like other robotic AIs,\\nAgentic AI systems are promoted to have rationalism in\\nthem, which enables each system [9] to reason and adapt\\nto different scenarios and such circumstances in a sufficient\\nway to accomplish goals. Due to its tendencies to enhance its\\nfunctions to prepare for any obstacles, Agentic AI has been\\nseen as a potential point of anchor for tasks and goals that\\nrequire high levels of interactions, for example, autonomous\\ndevices, collaborative robots, and interactive decision support\\nsystems in the areas of finance and health care.\\nThe increasing demand for systems capable of\\nautonomously handling intricate and dynamic processes\\nhas led to growing interest in Agentic AI, particularly in\\nsectors with a scope for AI automation. Though built on\\nbasic AI principles, Agentic AI increases the scope of AI\\nachievement by adding the elements of dependence and\\nadaptive independent action. The ecosystem of AI occupies a\\nspace between purely reactive and narrowly rule-based AI\\ntechnologies and broader ideas about AGI, performing an\\nessential function of enabling autonomous decision-making\\nwithin defined boundaries or structures. This unique position\\naccentuates the ability of Agentic AI to fit in scenarios\\nwhere the ability to make rapid decisions, manage over-\\ntime objectives, and learn on the go are fundamentals to the\\nproblem at hand.\\nB. COMPARISON WITH TRADITIONAL AI\\nAI, which can be described as ‘Agentic’ has its core\\ndifferences when compared to the other advanced types\\nof AIs in terms of autonomy, function, and scope, among\\nothers. Such AI systems are integrated into specific tasks\\nlike image analysis [10], translation of languages [11], and\\nrecommendation engines [12], making them able to perform\\ndesignated tasks in a highly focused but characteristic narrow\\nmanner and scope. They are mostly based on supervised\\nlearning approaches on really big datasets where behavior is\\ndetermined by the input and instructions given to them by\\npeople. Thus, traditional AIs are best applied in controlled\\nenvironments with limited ability to micromanage situations\\nand rather more significant outcomes.\\nOn the other hand, Agentic AI systems can be described\\nas possessing the characteristic of open-endedness where\\nthere is no prescription of how the task should be achieved.\\nThey work with and adapt to rapidly changing conditions.\\nOn the other hand, while conventional AI systems might\\nbe accurate, they do not have the situational awareness\\nand goal-directed dynamics inherent in Agentic AI. A case\\nexample may include a factory’s AI model that is developed\\nto predict equipment failure. As much as the premise is good,\\nAI will not incorporate adaptive shifts in the way it predicts\\nfailures due to factors such as changes in the manufacturing\\nschedule or changes in wear patterns across machines. On the\\nother hand, Agentic AI could change its metrics estimation\\nprocesses depending on the context and adapt both its short\\nand long-term strategies, which is impossible with traditional\\nmodels.\\nAs shown in Table 1, Agentic AI systems not only adapt\\nbased on real-time context but also maintain the flexibility\\nto optimize for complex, long-term goals. These distinctions\\nillustrate Agentic AI’s value in scenarios where conventional,\\nrule-bound AI falls short, emphasizing its transformative\\nrole in addressing the demands of unpredictable, high-stakes\\nenvironments.\\nC. EXPANDED COMPARISON WITH CLASSICAL AGENTS\\nWhile classical AI systems are primarily rule-based or\\nsupervised-learning models designed for specific tasks,\\nAgentic AI integrates autonomy and adaptability, enabling\\nbroader functionality. The differences between these\\nparadigms are best illustrated with examples.\\n1) CLASSICAL AGENTS\\nThese agents excel in controlled environments. For example,\\nrule-based financial trading algorithms function effectively\\nwhen predefined parameters remain constant. However,\\nthey struggle with volatile market changes or unpredictable\\ndisruptions.\\n2) AGENTIC AI\\nIn contrast, Agentic AI-powered trading systems dynamically\\nadjust strategies based on real-time data, historical trends, and\\nunexpected market shifts, making them more resilient and\\nadaptive.\\n3) REINFORCEMENT LEARNING VERSUS\\nLANGUAGE-MODEL-BASED AGENTS\\nWhile reinforcement learning focuses on optimizing cumula-\\ntive rewards in a specific task environment, language-model-\\nbased agents extend this by interpreting complex natural\\nlanguage inputs and interacting with humans seamlessly.\\nFor example, an RL agent excels at optimizing gameplay\\n18914 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Table 2 highlights the key differences.\\nD. TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS\\nThe development of Agentic AI systems relies on core\\nalgorithms and frameworks that enable goal-directed behav-\\nior, contextual adaptation, and autonomous decision-making.\\nThese technical foundations incorporate advances in rein-\\nforcement learning, goal-oriented architectures, and adaptive\\ncontrol mechanisms.\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) [13] is central to many\\nagentic systems, as it equips AI models with the ability\\nto learn through trial and error. In RL, agents are trained\\nto maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with an\\nenvironment, adapting their actions to achieve specific goals\\nover time. This learning paradigm is particularly useful\\nfor Agentic AI because it enables systems to continuously\\nrefine their strategies based on feedback. As illustrated\\nin Figure 1, reinforcement learning supports ‘‘Learning\\nthrough interaction’’ and involves a trial-and-error approach\\nto optimize decisions over time.\\nGoal-Oriented Architectures [14] provide a structural\\nframework for managing complex objectives within Agentic\\nAI systems. Unlike traditional architectures, which often\\nfocus on single tasks, goal-oriented architectures enable\\nagents to prioritize and pursue multiple objectives simul-\\ntaneously. These architectures support a modular structure,\\nwhere larger goals are broken into manageable sub-goals.\\nIn the context of Figure 1, goal-oriented architectures\\nfacilitate ‘‘Managing complex objectives,’’ allowing agents\\nto approach tasks in structured steps.\\nAdaptive Control Mechanisms [15] ensure that Agentic\\nAI systems can adjust to changing environments. By incor-\\nporating adaptive control, agents recalibrate their parameters\\nin response to external variations, such as data shifts\\nor unexpected disruptions. Techniques like meta-learning,\\nwhere agents learn to adapt based on prior experiences,\\nenable greater resilience and flexibility. As shown in the\\nflowchart, adaptive control mechanisms provide ‘‘Environ-\\nmental adaptation,’’ allowing agents to maintain optimal\\nperformance even under changing conditions.\\nFigure 1 provides a visual representation of these\\ncore frameworks, illustrating how they interact to enable\\nautonomous, adaptable, and goal-driven behavior in Agentic\\nAI systems. Together, these technical foundations equip\\nAgentic AI with the structural and functional capabilities\\nnecessary to manage complex, evolving tasks independently,\\nsetting it apart from traditional AI systems that rely on rigidly\\ndefined parameters and instructions.\\nBy combining reinforcement learning, goal-oriented archi-\\ntectures, and adaptive control, Agentic AI systems achieve\\na level of autonomy and resilience that allows them to\\noperate effectively in diverse environments. This section\\nestablishes the technical basis for understanding the advanced\\ncapabilities of Agentic AI, providing a foundation for the\\nmethodologies and applications discussed in the following\\nsections.\\nIII. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF AGENTIC AI\\nA. AUTONOMY AND GOAL COMPLEXITY\\nAutonomy is one of the most sought-after qualities that\\nAgentic AI can possess. This is especially needed where\\ncomplex multi-goal scenarios are involved. Most tradi-\\ntional AI systems focus on completing one task and\\nare programmed with non-complicated input and output\\nrequirements to achieve that single goal. In contrast, systems\\npowered by agentic AI can move through multiple needed\\ntasks and shift from one basic one to multiple complex\\nend goals. Such systems come with a certain amount of\\nself-governance where continual supervision of a human\\nbeing is not mandatory, though at times preferred, and\\nAI agents function independently upon a predetermined or\\nevolving goal structure. One extra step does, however, require\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18915'),\n",

An example can\\nbe drawn from autonomous robotics [16], where such an\\nagentic system would demand the complete traversal from\\npoint A to point B, with the additional allowance of making\\ndiversions around the route, moving constraints such as task\\nhierarchy, time frames, energy expendable ratios, and safety\\nstandards. Such an understanding deepens the comprehension\\nof goal complexity, where high-order decision models are\\nused wherein goals guide analysis, planning, and action.\\nQuite clearly, then, as this enables Agentic AI systems to\\ncarry out intricate objectives that had been deconstructed\\ninto sub-tasks that could fit autonomously into an operational\\nstrategy coupled with adjustments.\\nB. ENVIRONMENTAL AND OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY\\nMoreover, Agentic AI’s capacity to operate within varied and\\nchanging circumstances is yet another characteristic of this\\nAI. Unlike past AI, built for the most optimum functions in\\na constant and easily predictable environment [17], Agentic\\nAIs integrate all the variability in the real world. This\\ninvolves adjusting quickly to environmental conditions, data\\nor pattern changes, and even time-worn or newly constituted\\nuser demands. In the case of AI agents for self-driving cars,\\nthe ideal Agent Did not Photoshop to comply with artificial\\nboundaries contained in traffic laws alone but would learn\\nnew road designs and try to understand how the behavior\\nof other drivers would be before deciding how to act in a\\nparticular situation when the need arises within a very short\\nperiod.\\nTo do this, Agentic AI systems, as a general rule, are\\nequipped with means for environmental interaction, on-the-\\nspot data processing, and situational context comprehension.\\nThese capabilities allow the system to keep track of and\\nactively participate in the operational parameters that are\\nprone to alterations even at the last minute. For instance,\\nchange control [18] in Agentic AI systems is typically\\nembedded within the Agent as reinforcement learning or\\nadaptive algorithms so that the Agent can work optimally\\nregardless of the changing conditions. These characteristic\\nfeatures make Agentic AI fit for use in environments with\\nmany dynamics where reactions must be rapid, such as in\\nDisaster management, healthcare, finance, etc.\\nC. INDEPENDENT DECISION-MAKING AND ADAPTABILITY\\nAutonomy and flexibility are core requirements for the\\nAgentic AI to work independently for long hours. In contrast\\nto rule-based systems, which merely do what they are told,\\nAgentic AI has to situate itself in its current context and\\nmake decisions as it is working, so it has to learn over time\\nand improve on its behavior. This type of decision-making\\nis commonly done through reinforcement learning or meta-\\nlearning when the AI agent gets feedback repeatedly and\\nimproves its behavior.\\nFlexibility allows Agentic AI to act differently in the\\nsame scenario and pursue the relevant goals.

This\\nrequires prioritizing goals and assessing possible courses of\\naction and their outcomes with respect to the system’s goals.\\nBecause of flexibility and autonomy in decision-making [19],\\nAgentic AI can reconceptualize its strategies and adapt to new\\ninformation adopted in the model to operate in a changing\\nenvironment.\\nTo further illustrate the integration process of Agentic\\nAI into society, Figure 2 outlines the key stages.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS\\nCompared to linear systems of regulation, Agentic AI stands\\nout because of its improved ability to remain autonomous,\\nfunction within an ever-changing context, and cope with\\nmultiple goals. In most cases, operative agents are created\\nwhere the functional area is characterized within rigid\\nboundaries, with unfailing and straightforward preconditions\\nfor successful performance. On the other hand, Agentic AI\\nsystems are designed to work on complex goals that have yet\\nto be structured and can be defined in a broad context.\\nAs shown in Table 3, traditional agents excel in structured\\ntasks but lack the flexibility required for adaptive, goal-\\noriented tasks in complex environments. Agentic AI advances\\nthese systems by introducing a high degree of autonomy\\nand adaptability, enabling the agent to interact with and\\nrespond to its environment in ways that extend beyond\\nsimple rule-following. This comparative analysis highlights\\nthe distinctive capabilities of Agentic AI, positioning it as a\\ntransformative approach in fields where independent, goal-\\ndriven, and context-aware behavior is essential.\\nIV. METHODOLOGIES IN AGENTIC AI DEVELOPMENT\\nA. ARCHITECTURAL APPROACHES\\nArchitectural approaches in Agentic AI typically involve\\nmodular and hierarchical designs that enable the system to\\nmanage complex goals and adapt to dynamic environments.\\nCommon architectures include multi-agent systems (MAS),\\nhierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), and goal-oriented\\nmodular architectures.\\n• Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): MAS [20] divides tasks\\namong multiple autonomous agents that collaborate or\\ncompete to achieve a common goal. This architecture is\\nparticularly useful in scenarios where complex goals can\\nbe decomposed into smaller tasks that individual agents\\ncan handle.\\n• Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL): HRL\\n[21] structures decision-making hierarchically, where\\nhigh-level agents define sub-goals, and low-level agents\\nexecute them. This approach is effective for managing\\ntasks with multiple levels of complexity.\\n• Goal-Oriented Modular Architectures: These archi-\\ntectures [22] organize agent functions into modular\\ncomponents, where each module specializes in specific\\naspects of the task. Such modularity enables flexibility\\nand scalability, allowing the agent to handle different\\ntasks by reconfiguring modules as needed.\\nB. LEARNING PARADIGMS\\nAgentic AI relies on several learning paradigms, each suited\\nto different types of tasks and goals. The main paradigms\\nused in agentic systems are supervised, unsupervised, and\\nreinforcement learning. Table 4 provides a comparison.\\nC. ADVANCEMENTS IN METHODOLOGIES\\nRecent advancements in Agentic AI methodologies have\\nfocused on key capabilities essential to modern agent design.\\nThese include reasoning and planning, tool use, memory\\nmechanisms, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and\\ninstruction fine-tuning [23].\\n1) REASONING AND PLANNING\\nThese frameworks enable agents to anticipate outcomes,\\nprioritize tasks, and adapt strategies dynamically. They\\nare critical for managing complex, multi-objective tasks\\nin evolving environments like disaster management and\\nautonomous navigation.\\n2) TOOL USE AND INTEGRATION\\nAgents equipped with the ability to interact with external\\ntools and APIs can perform computations, retrieve real-\\ntime data, and simulate scenarios, significantly enhancing\\ndecision-making processes.\\n3) MEMORY MECHANISMS\\nEpisodic and semantic memory models allow Agentic AI\\nsystems to retain contextual information, improving their\\nability to recall past interactions and optimize ongoing tasks.\\n4) RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)\\nRAG empowers agents to retrieve external knowledge\\ndynamically, enhancing the relevance and context of their\\noutputs. This capability is particularly significant in conver-\\nsational agents and real-time decision-making systems.\\n5) INSTRUCTION FINE-TUNING\\nThis process ensures that agents understand and execute\\nnuanced directives, enabling them to perform multi-step tasks\\nwith high precision and adaptability.\\nD. TRAINING AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES\\nTraining Agentic AI systems requires techniques that allow\\nagents to learn from interactions with complex environments.\\nCommon training techniques include simulation-based train-\\ning, curriculum learning, and multi-task learning.\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18917'),\n",

This summary provides a concise reference\\nfor understanding the core techniques driving Agentic AI\\ndevelopment.\\nV. APPLICATIONS OF AGENTIC AI\\nA. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\\nAgentic AI can potentially revolutionize multiple industries,\\nincluding healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing.\\nIn healthcare, for example, Agentic AI can be used to\\nanalyze incoming patient data, identify abnormal patterns,\\nand alert corresponding medical personnel to damage. AI-\\nbased devices could, for example, prevent the delay of\\nvital diagnoses by monitoring patients’ key health indicators\\nand notifying them when the situation worsens. In finance,\\nfor instance, Agentic AI algorithms can assist in making\\ninvestment transactions, detecting fraudulent activities, and\\nproviding tailored investment solutions. They are capable\\nof evaluating the situation on the exchange, independently\\nmaking decisions regarding the purchase or sale of securities,\\nand adjusting their strategies to changing conditions in\\nreal time, which significantly improves the quality of\\nmanagerial performance and reduces the participation of\\nhuman beings [1].\\nIn education, intelligent tutoring systems utilizing Agen-\\ntic AI technology assist learners by tailoring educational\\ncontent [31] to their needs and addressing their progress\\nand requests. Such an approach leads to enhanced academic\\nperformance and decreased pressure on teachers because\\nrepetitive tasks such as grading and finding appropriate\\nmaterials are done automatically. In manufacturing, Agentic\\nAI is applied to predictive maintenance where the state of\\nthe machines is assessed, future breakdowns are anticipated\\nand maintenance is carried out when necessary without the\\ninvolvement of people so that production runs smoothly with\\nminimal delay. It is clear that once implemented, Agentic\\nAI enables industries to operate with greater effectiveness,\\nflexibility, and scalability.\\nB. HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION\\nAgentic AI extends the range of human productivity in\\ncollaborative and cognitive domains [32]. In such knowledge-\\nintensive ventures as legal or research, it can support pro-\\nfessionals by automatically condensing documents, pulling\\nup relevant papers, or performing professional background\\ninvestigations so the users can concentrate on more complex\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18919'),\n",

For example, in legal practice [33],\\nAgentic AI can examine a corpus of legal text, remember\\nessential documents and help lawyers retrieve cases with\\nsimilar laws.\\nIn the creative industries, Agentic AI can draft text, develop\\ndesign concepts, or make creative alterations based on earlier\\nedits or client input. Agentic AI tools are expected to be able\\nto reduce such needless tasks and improve the productivity of\\ncontent development. Also, in customer services, Agent AI\\ncan take care of simple questions, offer assistance, and route\\ncomplicated problems to human agents, enhancing response\\ntime and client satisfaction. This seamless integration of\\nhuman-AI collaboration enables workers to spend their\\ntime in a more strategic and creative workspace. At the\\nsame time, Agentic AI takes care of the operational\\naspects.\\nC. ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS\\nThere is a gradual move towards Agentic AI in adaptive\\nor ‘‘living’’ software systems [34], which can change their\\nfeatures without typical limitations and dynamically modify\\ntheir functionalities depending on environmental evolvement.\\nThese variables make the system reconfigure itself rapidly or\\nautomatically to ensure that self-learning improves every time\\naround usage. These include real-time updates of suggestions\\nby people as a function of the recommendations and updates\\nof suggestions based on changes in the evolution of the user\\nrecommendations dynamically.\\nOther cases include automated activities in the smart house\\nwhere, because of the powered agentic AI, boarders can\\nchange the lighting, temperatures and security protocols for\\ninbuilt AI to note the behavior of the users. In project\\ndevelopment processes, for instance, Agentic AI project\\nmanagement bots can focus on task sequencing, workload\\ndistribution, and task timeline complexity to dynamically\\nalter timelines [35] where necessary, which enables the users\\nto suit the various changes in the project quite effectively.\\nSuch adaptive software applications reduce human-in-the-\\nloop requirements and enhance the usability and functionality\\nof the system.\\nD. EMERGING APPLICATION AREAS\\nWith dynamic patient needs demanding continuous respon-\\nsiveness, there are new targeted use cases for applying\\nAgentic AI in specific spheres. Such include personalized\\nmedicine [36], where an Agentic AI system could manage\\nchronic patients by overseeing their patient history, sending\\nmedication intake reminders [37], and changing treatment\\nrecommendations based on other health indicators. Such\\nsystems would provide individualistic care-management\\nprotocol and even monitor for early indicators of other\\nprogressing health conditions, especially for aged people\\nlikely to require maximum attention.\\nFor literature creation, Agentic AI is expected to acquire\\nnew roles in generating content automatically, targeting\\nwider audiences and meeting precise parameters in content\\ncreation. For instance, in marketing, Agentic AI systems\\nwould send customized emails and adverts based on user\\nactivity and generate content for the adverts in the first\\nplace. Furthermore, in the context of self-regulatory research,\\nScientists using Agentic AI can accomplish the objectives of\\na literature search, developing new lines of thought, and even\\ncreating research designs. Faster research periods could be\\nwitnessed in the fields of drug development [38] research\\nor climate change research.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF AGENTIC AI\\nIMPLEMENTATIONS\\nA. COMPARISON METRICS\\nTo comprehensively assess and triangulate Agentic AI\\ndeployments, it is necessary to identify metrics commensu-\\nrate with their output, flexibility and leverage. The following\\nmetrics are prevailing in the field:\\n• Adaptability: This metric considers the AI system’s\\npropensity or capability to react to environmental\\nmodifications that are prompt or abrupt actively. A high\\nadaptability [39] score means the AI system can undergo\\nperformance losses due to novel conditions like shifts\\nin statistical measures, but not to the extent of incurring\\nsignificant losses.\\n• Goal Achievement Efficiency: This metric reflects on\\nthe AI’s inclination or ability to achieve its goals while\\nusing minimal resources such as time and person-hours.\\nThis metric becomes critical in applications where the\\nprovision of the AI model’s determinism has strong\\nconsequences on the feasibility of the application.\\n• Learning Rate and Convergence: Measures the time\\nthe AI takes to learn and attach to a specific task. Quick\\nlearning rate and quick convergence are always preferred\\nas they enable the AI to work effectively in dynamic\\nenvironments requiring continual learning [40], [41].\\n• Robustness and Resilience: This measure determines\\nthe system’s performance level when its parameters\\nchange or during disturbances. Robustness [42], [43]is\\none attribute that enables the effective design of Agentic\\nAI, which can operate in several vitiating circumstances,\\nsuch as unexpected scenarios well deepened in the\\nhealthcare and autonomous driving sectors.\\n• Scalability: It refers to the system’s qualities, which\\nmust not change as the range or complexity of tasks\\nchanges. This is an important characteristic in indus-\\ntries with significant volumes of data or operational\\nprocesses, such as the case with finance or manufactur-\\ning [44].\\n• User Satisfaction and Human-AI Collaboration Effi-\\nciency: User satisfaction with Agentic AI systems\\ndependent on human interaction [45], [46] is a key\\nperformance indicator. This metric examines how lan-\\nguage, particularly AI’s involvement, translates into\\nproductivity, usability, and support quality for human\\ndoers.\\nTable 8 summarizes these metrics, providing a basis\\nfor evaluating Agentic AI implementations across various\\napplications.\\nB.

BENCHMARKING\\nBenchmarking is one of the most important procedures\\nfor assessing Agentic AI performance and its standard\\nmodel. This step is important as it allows model researchers\\nand developers to model. Some several standardized\\nbenchmarking datasets and environments have been devel-\\noped and are now used to carry out Agentic AI:\\n• Healthcare Datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, PhysioNet):\\nHealth care datasets [53], [54] are applied in the training\\nand evaluating systems for AI designs for patient\\nmonitoring, clinical diagnostic prediction, and clinical\\ndecision support. The claim that an Agentic AI system is\\ndoing an excellent job in Health care benchmarks shows\\nthat it is possible to make AI systems that can precisely\\nwork with such sensitive and life-critical information.\\n• Financial Data (e.g., Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ his-\\ntorical data): Fundamental datasets of respondents with\\nsales records [55] such as the historical stock prices are\\nvery useful for an Agentic AI, capable of predictive\\nanalytics and algorithmic trading. These datasets can\\nalso be used to rate the performance regarding prediction\\nability, robustness in fluctuating volatile markets, and\\nprofitability of trades.\\n• Autonomous Driving Simulators (e.g., CARLA, Ope-\\nnAI Gym): The environments allow for driving testing\\nfor autonomous navigation tasks and for AI in vehicles.\\nAI systems’ rate of learning, as well as their adaptive\\ncapability, are also tested under such environments [56],\\n[57]. Simulators are especially helpful in tests that\\ndemand systems to perform similar tasks of safety and\\ndecision-making under various conditions.\\n• Customer Service Datasets (e.g., MultiWOZ, Ama-\\nzon Customer Reviews): Efficient and personalized\\nAI-augmented customer interactions are evaluated in the\\ndimension of User and Systems or Support collaboration\\nwhere this set of data assists in the estimation of\\nsuch measures. The ability to perform well on these\\nbenchmarks is a direct indicator of the agent’s ability to\\nattend to user concerns as well as hold up to complex\\ninquiries.\\n• Manufacturing and IoT Datasets (e.g., NASA Prog-\\nnostics Data Repository): This data source consists of\\nsensor data from industrial equipment that is utilized to\\ntrain the AI application for predictive maintenance [58],\\n[59].

These sys-\\ntems enhance healthcare delivery, particularly in high-\\ndemand scenarios.\\n• In finance, algorithmic trading powered by Agentic AI\\nhas demonstrated superior performance during volatile\\nmarket conditions by dynamically adjusting trading\\nstrategies.\\n• In manufacturing, predictive maintenance systems have\\nreduced downtime by proactively anticipating equip-\\nment failures and scheduling maintenance.\\nLimitations\\n• Healthcare systems often require extensive data prepro-\\ncessing and struggle with data heterogeneity.\\n• Financial AI models may overfit historical trends,\\nlimiting adaptability to novel events.\\n• Manufacturing systems face integration issues with\\nlegacy equipment and scalability constraints.\\nLessons Learned\\n• Effective Agentic AI implementations require robust\\ndata pipelines and high-quality training datasets.\\n• Incorporating feedback mechanisms and human over-\\nsight improves performance and ensures ethical compli-\\nance.\\n• Hybrid models combining classical and agentic\\nparadigms often yield superior results, as seen in\\ncomplex, multi-stakeholder environments.\\nAddressing these limitations while leveraging lessons learned\\nwill be critical for advancing Agentic AI across diverse\\ndomains.\\nVII. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS\\nA. GOAL ALIGNMENT AND COMPLEXITY\\nA critical consideration in the design of any system is how the\\nautonomously set goals of the AI will agree with the diverse\\nperspectives of social morals and human users’ objectives.\\nIn more simplified terms, it is not like how AI generally\\noperates today, where there are set commands to follow.\\nIn contrast, agentic AI benefits from possessing a number\\nof highly complex goals, and these goals may evolve over\\ntime. There is a straightforward design problem here because\\npeople’s goals do not always lead to intended outcomes,\\nwhich could, for example, call for developing inappropriate\\ngoals, techniques, or strategies.\\nHowever, the question of goal misalignment is sometimes\\nmore easily addressed than when the central goals of the\\nprojects are multi-dimensional and contingent on the project\\ncontext. For example, in the case of medical ethics, an AI\\nagent operating for a maximum recovery rate of the patients\\nmight be focusing on those strategies that work fast and\\ngive results even in the short term but may not be the\\nbest thing in the long term. Furthermore, these issues are\\nintertwined with ethical goals and values structures, which\\nare difficult to articulate and integrate within the goal system\\ndue to cross-cultural or industry particularities. Addressing\\nthis problem is a requirement because other researchers are\\ninvestigating aligned frameworks like value alignment and\\ninverse reinforcement learning, wherein the etic systems are\\ncongruent with the emic reward systems. However, these\\nexplanations are still at the very basic understanding and\\nneed a lot of work to cope with complex changes in human\\ngoals.\\nB. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SITUATIONAL ADAPTABILITY\\nAs mentioned earlier, agentic AIs tend to be used in\\ndynamic and highly complex environments. This adaptability\\nchallenge relates to adapting to real-world conditions, which\\nmay change within a narrow time frame without human\\nintervention. In practical terms, it is quite challenging to\\nbe highly adaptive, as many dynamics in the real world\\nare highly unpredictable such as market trends in financial\\ninvestment, epidemiological trends in health care, or even\\njourney events in autonomous cars.\\nFor most agentic AI systems, technological or contextual\\nbarriers require action even when there is incomplete infor-\\nmation, increasing performance reliability ambiguities. For\\ninstance, in the case of autonomous driving, the agentic AI\\nmay not be familiar with the surrounding traffic conditions or\\nweather patterns such as snow or heavy rainfall, necessitating\\nthe need to adapt in a safe manner to maintain efficiency.\\nWhile meta-learning and reinforcement learning can help\\nincrease the adaptability of agents by allowing them to learn\\nfrom their past, the limitations lie within the approaches\\nas well, as adaptation and robustness are difficult goals\\nto achieve. Furthermore, implementing machine learning\\nmodels based on generalized processes in such complex\\nenvironments usually requires a high computing time, which\\nis only sometimes practical.\\nC. RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS\\nAgentic AIs are complex systems that require lots of\\ncomputation and energy resources for their training and\\ndeployment phases in navigable spaces. One is reinforcement\\nlearning, which greatly relies on simulation and data\\nprocessing and consequently increases the cost and time of\\n18924 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Milling out time for resource demands in\\nreal-time decision-making circumstances is a big challenge\\nin applications such as the finance industry and autonomous\\nvehicles.\\nIn addition, hardware is another resource for Agentic AI,\\nas these systems usually require specialized facilities when\\ndeployed in real-world environments. For instance, if an\\nautonomous drone or robot is to be used, it would require\\nhigh-performing GPUs, low-latency sensors, and a vital\\nenergy source to enable prompt decision-making. In addition,\\nthe proliferation of agentic systems, especially those based\\non centralized control and monitoring, can put an increasing\\nstrain on data storage, processing and network bandwidth\\nresources. Coupled with these challenges are the hardware\\noptimization methods and energy-efficient algorithms that\\nwill be required to implement Agentic AI systems largely and\\ncost-effectively efficiently.\\nD. SCALABILITY\\nWith the complexity of design increasing, scaling improves\\nthe system’s performance. Some applications of Agent AI,\\nwhether in smart cities, healthcare, or financial services,\\nare massive in scale, requiring a higher AI-to-agent ratio,\\nmultifaceted tasks, or huge amounts of data to be handled.\\nHowever, it is nontrivial to ensure that such systems can\\nbe scaled up to a higher level without losing some key\\nperformance metrics, as it usually involves a multitude of\\nconcurrent tasks and data sources.\\nMultiple agents or components design and their interaction\\npresents a major challenge regarding scalability. For example,\\nin a smart city, there may be an AI that manages traffic,\\nenergy, and waste collection. Different architectures must\\nbe capable of getting required subsystems to work together\\nand perform complex tasks simultaneously. Besides, as most\\narchitects understand, the scaling of Agent AI also magnifies\\nproblems like goal dependency, resource usage, and the\\nability to act in plenty of scenarios. Today, decentralized\\ncontrol, federated learning, and hierarchical structures are\\nbeing used or researched to improve scalability. However,\\nthe problem remains as scaling out seamless techniques is\\na technological limitation related to AI operating at a larger\\nscale.\\nTable 10 provides a summary of the primary technical\\nchallenges and limitations faced in the development and\\ndeployment of Agentic AI. Addressing these challenges is\\nessential to advancing the field and ensuring that Agentic\\nAI systems can function effectively and responsibly in real-\\nworld scenarios.\\nVIII. ETHICAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\\nIMPLICATIONS\\nA. ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY\\nIn light of the decision-making independence such systems\\ndisplay, understanding accountability and responsibility in\\nAgentic AI systems is a complex challenge. With the more\\ntraditional AI systems, tools fall under the purview of people\\n– the developer, the operator, or the user and the responsibility\\nrests with the person who uses the tool. With Agentic AI,\\nthe question of accountability is more contentious due to\\nthe nature of an independent-acting AI. In situations where\\nautonomous AI makes a decision that results in a negative\\noutcome, the question of responsibility is often misplaced;\\nis it the developer, the service provider who deploys the AI,\\nor the AI system.\\nThis particular issue comes out clearly in areas such as\\nfinance and healthcare, where such systems deal with high-\\nstakes decision-making with high repercussions. There needs\\nto be a more significant gap between the responsibility and\\nliability attribution frameworks and the behavioral intricacies\\npresent in Agentic AI systems. Therefore, Regulations and\\npossibly new legal structures must be invoked to delineate\\nresponsibility or accountability, especially in environments\\nwhere multiple stakeholders are participating in the execution\\nof the system, which is most of the time.\\nB. BIAS, FAIRNESS, AND TRANSPARENCY\\nIt is also known that agentic AI systems may replicate and\\nexacerbate biases in the training data available to them. The\\nnotion of bias is especially concerning regarding the use of\\nAgentic AI in hiring, policing, and lending practices. Not\\nonly must these biases be acknowledged, but they must also\\nbe addressed through appropriate data management, careful\\nalgorithm deployment, and active bias reduction programs.\\nStill, it is essential to note that addressing bias and mitigating\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18925'),\n",

Technical challenges and limitations in agentic AI.\\nit in autonomous systems is a much more difficult task than\\nin traditional AI because of the nature of the tasking such\\nsystems are designed to perform.\\nAnother important aspect that also helps enhance fairness\\nand trust in Agentic AI [60] systems is transparency.\\nThese systems’ operations must be explained through\\nXAI approaches, and there must be an effort to make\\ntransparent decision-making processes for end users and\\nrelevant stakeholders. This exposure can help effectively\\ncheck an AI’s actions and create a framework for tackling\\nbias or injustice. However, explainability is quite challenging\\nto attain fundamentally, and a more significant deal of\\nit is supposed to be achieved in cases of agentic AI\\nsystems, which tend to use deep reinforcement learning\\nmodels. This area of concern has always been find-\\ning the right balance between structural complexity and\\ntransparency.\\nC. PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES\\nThe agents can perform their functions effectively in different\\nenvironments by relying on relevant information, often\\nprivate in domains like healthcare and finance, that are\\nalready sensitive areas. Such reliance on personal information\\ninvites privacy concerns as data can be mishandled and even\\naccessed illegally, leading to a large breach of user privacy.\\nAdditionally, in this context, the autonomous ability of the\\nAgentic AI can pose a challenge as the data usage can be\\ndifficult to track, thus increasing the likelihood of privacy\\nabuse.\\nThere is also a security challenge in that cyber-attacks can\\nthreaten these systems, undermining their intended purpose\\nand exposing weaknesses in the system in place. If agentic AI\\nsystems are hacked, they could bring forth a lot of destruction,\\nprimarily when the systems govern critical infrastructure or\\nsensitive tasks that need to be decided within that context.\\nThere is a great need to maintain a robust and holistic\\napproach towards cybersecurity, as it is required to secure\\nthe information that such systems depend on and their\\nfunctionality. While techniques such as differential privacy\\nand secure multi-party computation may seem promising,\\nprivacy and security threats still exist, so implementation\\nshould be done carefully to retain the required functional\\nprivacy.\\nD. REGULATORY AND LEGAL PERSPECTIVES\\nThe regulatory and legal perspective on Agentic AI is\\nstill a work in progress as regulators try to streamline\\nthe unique challenges that autonomous systems present.\\nThe AI regulations as they stand today mainly address\\nprivacy, transparency, and accountability issues but may\\nnot necessarily tackle the challenges posed by Agentic\\nAI’s autonomy. For instance, the like of the EU’s General\\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) [61] imposes stringent\\nobligations with respect to data and user consent, but these\\nrequirements may not be adequate when managing AI\\nsystems that operate in real-time with autonomous decisions.\\nPolicymakers [62] are also investigating other frameworks,\\nparticularly for high-risk AI systems. Some approaches\\ncall for an ‘‘AI responsibility chain,’’ which can help\\nstakeholders determine the accountability of each party of\\nthe AI systems. In contrast, others recommend a mandatory\\nexplainability for some AI applications. Legal standards for\\nAgentic AI are likely to include risk management plans\\nthat contain requirements for conducting risk assessments,\\nperiodic audits, and certifications for systems operating in\\nsusceptible sectors such as health, finance, and security. It is,\\nhowever, expected that as Agentic AI progresses, developing\\nlegal frameworks that enable innovation while enhancing\\nsafety and accountability will be crucial.\\nTable 11 summarizes the primary ethical and governance\\nconsiderations for Agentic AI, highlighting the complexities\\nthat arise as these systems become increasingly autonomous.\\nIX. CURRENT FRAMEWORKS FOR SAFE AND\\nACCOUNTABLE AGENTIC AI\\nA. SAFETY PROTOCOLS\\nSeveral safety measures and frameworks have been created\\nas a requirement to prevent the autonomous risks involved\\nwith decision-making. One of the most basic methods is\\ngoal safety protocols, being objective-oriented procedures\\nto suggest to the AI which goals are acceptable to pursue\\nand which actions are harmful. These protocols prevent\\nharm by ensuring that AI endeavors to achieve legal, safe,\\nand ethical goals. Also, to prevent AI from going out of\\nbounds or reaching unanticipated dangerous situations, fail-\\nsafe mechanisms [63] are deployed, which can adjust or even\\nterminate AI activities altogether.\\n18926 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nTABLE 11. Ethical and governance considerations for agentic AI.\\nOne such framework primarily employed is the risk\\nevaluation and management protocol [64], which leads\\nto the review of the risks posed by the actions of the AI,\\nand subsequently, the control measures are put in place.\\nThis is especially important in healthcare and autonomous\\ndriving scenarios, where AI takes actions that impact human\\nlives. Additionally, some Agentic AI systems utilize ethical\\nguardrails [65], which restrain the AI from making decisions\\nthat raise ethical concerns and promote the AI to perform\\naccording to social norms and ethics. The illustrated safety\\nprotocols work as a system of layers, offering a good level of\\nprotection for the abuse of Agentic AI in an ethical manner.\\nB. MONITORING AND CONTROL MECHANISMS\\nThe autonomous action of agentic AI systems requires\\nmonitoring and control mechanisms to govern such actions\\nand allow for human intervention where necessary. Real-time\\nmonitoring systems [66], [67] oversee the AI’s activities and\\ndecisions and allow humans to intervene if necessary. For\\nexample, in the case of financial trading systems, AI can\\nbe employed to identify unusual trade patterns in real-time\\ntrading by alerting the relevant authorities and allowing for\\nthe conduct of such activities to be at acceptable risk levels.\\nSuch frameworks as Human-in-the-loop (HITL) [68]\\nand human-on-the-loop (HOTL) [69] have been designed\\nwith the idea of maintaining an equilibrium between the\\nextent of autonomy experienced and the necessity of human\\ncontrol. When HITL configurations are deployed, human\\noperators tend to approve some actions and directly interact\\nwith the AI while making certain decisions. On the other\\nhand, in HOTL systems, the human supervisor monitors the\\nAI without deciding on every action but can intervene when\\nnecessary. These mechanisms are essential for healthcare and\\nother serious decisions involving AI, where the presence of\\nhuman intelligence is still required.\\nOverride protocols also exist in Agentic AI systems to\\nstop or change actions undertaken by the AI if a situation is\\nclassified as unforeseen or falls outside the reasonable range\\nof expected behavior. Last-line systems provide another\\nlevel of defense by making it possible for the AI to\\nbe overpowered by a human if its autonomous conduct\\nbecomes damaging. Combined with the aforementioned,\\nthese monitoring and control measures are designed to\\ndeliver a multitude of defense in depth to ensure that the\\nagentic artificial intelligence does not exceed controlled and\\nsupervised settings, with all sorts of human intervention\\nprocedures firmly in place.\\nC. TRANSPARENCY MECHANISMS\\nTrust and accountability are foundational to the deployment\\nof Agentic AI, and both can be eroded owing to lack of\\ntransparency. Explainable AI (XAI) [70], [71] techniques\\nhave been proposed to offer a more transparent view of\\nthe inner workings of these multi-layered decision-making\\nAI models. As a result, XAI enriches the accountability of\\nthe processes involved in reaching decisions as leaders in a\\nparticular field, such as that of finance and healthcare, where\\ndecisions have profound consequences, are informed about\\nthe premises on which specific actions were taken.\\nBeyond just the transparent nature, audit trails can also\\nbe added as an extra layer within Agentic AI systems\\nto document every logic and decision so that the actions\\ntaken by the AI can be examined afterward. These logs are\\nperfect for compliance because they can assist organizations\\nin ensuring that past choices were compliant with the\\nlaw. Self-documenting algorithms [72] also help promote\\nself-explainable AI by automatically preparing reports and\\nexplanations about the system’s decisions while it is in\\noperation. Such mechanisms not only foster transparency\\nbut also facilitate feedback mechanisms, as they enable\\ndevelopers and stakeholders to improve and understand the\\ndecision-making process of the AI over time.\\nD. CASE STUDIES OF GOVERNANCE APPROACHES\\nSeveral industry and academic efforts have created gover-\\nnance frameworks to guarantee the safe, responsible and\\nethical use of AI. Here are several examples that are worth\\nmentioning [73]:\\n• Microsoft’s AI Principles and Responsible AI Stan-\\ndard: These include fairness, reliability, privacy, inclu-\\nsiveness, and transparency, which govern the shaping\\nof AI systems according to Microsoft’s Responsible AI\\nStandard. It also contains the Aether Committee, which\\nfairly addresses the ethical and social issues brought\\nabout by AI.

OPEN RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND FUTURE\\nDIRECTIONS\\nThe development and deployment of Agentic AI systems\\npresent several open research challenges that require attention\\nto ensure safe, effective, and ethically aligned AI. This\\nsection explores these challenges and outlines potential future\\ndirections for advancing Agentic AI.\\nA. ENHANCED ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE\\nIn dynamic and uncertain contexts, Agentic AI systems must\\ndemonstrate adaptability and resilience as they operate in the\\nenvironment. Most existing models do not generalize across\\nthe environments or change significantly without retraining.\\nThus, future work might involve solving meta-learning\\nand transfer-learning problems specifically for Agentic AI\\nsystems, allowing them to rapidly adapt to new situations\\nbased on their previous experiences. Moreover, it would be\\ninteresting to research on platforms that enable real-time\\nlearning whereby agents learn and modify in response to\\nchanges but their primary functions are not affected. This\\nwould improve both resilience and adaptability tremendously.\\nB. IMPROVING GOAL ALIGNMENT WITH HUMAN VALUES\\nIntegrating ethical and value-based human approaches into\\nAgentic AI systems is one of the open branches of research\\nthat should be advanced in the future. Given the autonomous\\nnature of operating these systems, there exists the possibility\\nof a goal misalignment problem whereby the AI is driven\\nto do the right thing. Still, the action is contrary to human\\ninterests. This work can explore value alignment strategies\\nsuch as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and cooperative\\ninverse reinforcement learning (CIRL), in which the AI goes\\nthrough experience and exposure to human social context\\nto learn human preferences and values. In addition, such\\nframeworks should be created that would permit real-time\\nadjustments to the level of alignment between Agentic AI and\\nhuman objectives depending on changing social behavior or\\nthe targeted audience’s cues.\\nC. INTEGRATION INTO LIVING SOFTWARE AND\\nCYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS\\nWhen Agentic AI is widespread, developing robust ethical\\nand global guidelines for this technology application and\\ndevelopment will be essential. Autonomous decision-making\\nin the systems complicates ethical issues like bias, privacy,\\naccountability, and transparency. Areas of future research\\ncan be directed at how to build a universal ethical frame-\\nwork for Agentic AI, which may include mechanisms of\\nmultidimensional ethical audit, oversight, and certification.\\nThis includes initiatives involving policymakers, ethicists,\\nand AI practitioners to embed supervisory mechanisms that\\nfoster advancements without undermining other societal\\ninterests [75].\\nD.

Theoretical research into topics such as multi-agent\\ncoordination, decentralized decision-making, and long-term\\ngoal management could provide new insights into enhancing\\nAI autonomy while maintaining control [78]. Additionally,\\nadvancing our understanding of cognitive functions like\\ncuriosity, intrinsic motivation, and moral reasoning in arti-\\nficial agents could help design more robust and ethically\\naligned Agentic AI systems. Developing formal models of\\nAI agency will be essential for ensuring these systems\\ncan act responsibly and predictably in diverse and complex\\nenvironments.\\nTable13 provides a summary of the primary open research\\nchallenges and future directions in Agentic AI. Each area\\nhighlights critical aspects of advancing the field responsibly\\nand sustainably.\\nF. SCALABILITY AND EFFICIENCY\\nThe deployment of Agentic AI systems in large-scale and\\ncomplex environments imposes new constraints, resulting in\\nvast requirements for scalability and efficiency. There are\\nscenarios when such systems need to manage resources and\\ninformation at large, interact with numerous agents, and make\\ndecisions within a short period. For both scalability and\\nefficiency to be achieved, new advancements in algorithms,\\narchitectures, and hardware have to be made. This research\\narea is characterized by the use of centerless and hierarchical\\nframeworks and distributed processing or energy-efficient\\nhardware.\\nAside from its numerous advantages, a well-known\\nlimitation that stems from the emergence of decentralized\\narchitectures is their integration into large-scale systems.\\nSince the control process can be handled by numerous nodes\\nin a fully distributed way, there is no need for a single\\ncentralized controller. Thus, the responsibility and load of this\\nnode do not affect the system’s scalability. An improvement\\nof specific processes in this-style architecture might include\\ncertain structural, behavioral rules that regularize agents’\\nactions regarding network interactions. The more structures\\ndecorated with efficient elements of decentralized control,\\nthe quicker the optimized directional tasks and networks as\\na whole system will be, where optimization processes occur\\nin bulks of intelligent agents. As it has become apparent in\\nrecent years, these tasks have become possible with systems\\nbased on swarm intelligence and decentralized [79] control\\nof structures and processes.\\nAnother area of interest is the hierarchical models,\\nwhich break down decision-making processes into different\\nlayers [80], where the system can only focus on general goals\\nand distribute particular actions to subordinate agents. For\\ninstance, in the smart city context, a hierarchical Agentic\\nAI could oversee the movement of cars throughout the\\ncity. At the same time, local agents manage the traffic\\nat a particular intersection. This configuration diminishes\\nthe computation each agent has to perform and enables\\nbetter system scalability. The hierarchical models have found\\nmuch application in the coordinated control of multiple,\\ninterdependent processes in a system since they allow for\\nagnostic task scheduling as the state of the system changes.\\nBalanced loading of tasks among processors is another\\nfactor that improves scalability since it allows distribut-\\ning computations over several devices or servers. Within\\ndistributed processing frameworks, large scale Agentic AI\\nsystems could make the most of cloud or edge computing\\nresources to carry out computation in multiple processes and\\nlower the time taken to respond. Such a situation proves\\nhelpful in operating in remote applications or in time-critical\\nsituations such as autonomous vehicles or smart grid sys-\\ntems where real-time data processing and decision-making\\nare critical.

Summary of open research challenges and future directions in agentic AI.\\nbecome increasingly complex. Future directions in this area\\ninclude the development of adaptive resource allocation\\ntechniques [85] that dynamically allocate computational\\nresources based on task importance, as well as self-\\noptimizing algorithms [86] that adjust their complexity\\ndynamically depending on the requirements. Moreover,\\nthanks to collaborative intelligence [87] conception, agents\\nwill be able to solve issues without complicated integration\\nprocesses as they will be able to handle sophisticated\\noperations collectively, thus enhancing system scalability.\\nG. ENHANCED ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE\\nAgentic AI systems, particularly those employed by a human\\nworker or soldier, are built to endure persistence under\\ndemanding, unpredictable conditions. Therefore, achieving\\npersistent operational success would require these systems to\\nmodify their actions autonomously and gain further learning\\nresilience constantly. How can one reach such a high level\\nof learning resilience? One possible answer lies in the use of\\nAgentic AI technologies that can generalize across different\\nenvironments and concepts, deal with high uncertainty, and\\ncope with unforeseen interruptions.\\nOne exciting way of achieving such resilience is through\\nmeta-learning, or what children call ‘‘learning to learn.’’\\nSuch meta-learning algorithms enable an AI to learn informa-\\ntion that may apply to different assignments or environments,\\nallowing the AI to be flexible with virtually no retraining.\\nFor example, in robotic tasks [88], a meta-learning agent\\nraised in one environment (let’s say, in the house) can move\\nto an alternative environment (the outside) and assume the\\nknowledge of moving within the outside environment. This\\nis because AI can now learn like humans [89] and use\\nits past experiences in the environment to approach new\\nsituations [90].\\nAnother significant approach for enhancing adaptability is\\ncalled transfer learning [91]. It has proved that unlike static\\nmodels trained for a particular purpose, a learning model\\ntrained for one task can perform a similar or even related,\\nyet distinct, task. This method is particularly convenient for\\nAgentic AIs acting in many different operational spheres,\\nenabling the system to leverage its previous lessons instead of\\nacquiring new ones. Transfer learning is known to be effective\\nduring these scenarios since it allows the AI to adjust to\\ndifferent patient profiles or drive in different environments,\\nsuch as autonomous driving.\\nResilience in the case of Agentic AI systems is crucial\\nas it allows them to deliver consistent outcomes despite\\nupsets being caused by compromised sensors, intermittent\\nnetworks or external factors that were not anticipated.\\nTo increase resilience, there are ongoing investigations on\\nrobust reinforcement learning techniques that enable the\\nreliable functioning of agents in the presence of consistent\\nuncertainty or unknown noise. Robust reinforcement learning\\nmethods rely on dual dynamics, allowing the learner to\\nseek performance maximization and impact minimization\\nof stochastic events. This dual objective ensures the agent\\ncan effectively implement its functionalities even when the\\nnormal conditions vary.\\nSelf-recovery mechanisms are being explored as sup-\\nplementary to everyday learning strategies. Self-recovery\\nmechanisms allow Agentic AI systems to auto-flag and\\nrectify their duplicates without help. For example, self-\\nrecovery strategies in autonomous robotics may include\\nobstacle avoidance strategies where the robot uses an\\nalternative approach or site configuration strategies. System\\nself-recovery mechanisms allow seamless system restoration\\nafter a range of disruptions, which is particularly beneficial\\nto mission-critical areas like disaster management and space\\nexploration, where human intervention is not always feasible.\\nThe stand-out areas of research that are helpful in both the\\nmodification and robustness of Agentic AI include real-time\\nlearning. AI self-recovery mechanisms [92], on the other\\nhand, include real-time learning. This mechanism allows\\nAI systems to receive and integrate new information into\\nrelevant models without ceasing operational activities. This is\\nexcellent, for example, in the finance or cyber warfare zones\\nmodels, which require swift AI alterations on market changes\\nor threats. However, with this capability, new challenges also\\narise related to the real-time processing of data, the ability to\\nconduct computation, model maintenance, and stability, and\\nthese need to be addressed in future studies.\\n18930 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nLooking to the future, progress in improving adaptability\\nand survivability will likely include the creation of context-\\naware learning algorithms [93], which evaluate the setting\\nand act by it. In other words, some form of contextual\\nAI could switch its unitary decision-making style depend-\\ning on uncertainty or resource availability. Furthermore,\\ninvestigation of multi-modal learning [94], [95], which\\nfuses information from multiple sources and types to better\\nunderstand different situations, may assist in improving the\\nversatility of Agentic AI systems in the operative context.\\nWith visual, auditory, and other kinds of information, multi-\\nmodal learning can be particularly effective for autonomous\\nvehicles trying to function in complex situations.\\nH. ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS AND GLOBAL STANDARDS\\nThe increasing capabilities of Autonomous Agentic AI\\nsystems operating in significant sectors have intensified\\nthe call for appropriate ethical considerations and global\\nstandards to be put in place. These considerations and\\nstandards are pivotal in regulating how Agentic AI interacts\\nwith stakeholders and the environment to minimize adverse\\nimpacts, biases, and threats to safety and privacy. In addition,\\nappropriate and well-thought-out ethical considerations and\\nglobal standards also seek to define the scope and areas of\\ntransparency, equity, accountability, and user privacy, which\\nneed to be emphasized in the design and use of AI.\\nOne of the critical barriers to establishing these frame-\\nworks is the existence of ethical and legal variety in\\ndifferent societies. Ethical issues, including data protection,\\ntransparency in who took the decision, and reliance on\\nautonomous decisions, may range from one society to another\\ndepending on legal order, customs, traditions, or politics.\\nFor these differences to be addressed while promoting\\nsynergies among regions, a global set of ethical standards\\nfor AI governance is fundamental. Establishing universal\\nethical principles can provide the basis for this alignment by\\ndeveloping common approaches to equity, non-maleficence\\nand beneficence that would override local differences.\\nTransparency and Explainability are undoubtedly the\\ncomponents of an ethical algorithm since they allow third\\nparties to comprehend the decision-making process of artifi-\\ncial intelligence. In Agentic AI, such attributes are necessary\\nfor users’ trust, especially in crucial sectors like healthcare\\nand finance, where the rationale behind the decision needs\\nto be accountable. These include XAI techniques that\\nallow stakeholders to explain the interpretation process.\\nTherefore, given the erosion of these fundamental rights,\\nthese frameworks should emphasize the need to incorporate\\nstakeholders’ responsibilities and authorities’ mechanisms to\\nscrutinize AI-generated decisions [96].\\nMore important and unwaveringly related to the develop-\\nment of ethical frameworks is the issue of an Accountability\\nand Responsibility. With the growing autonomy of agents in\\nsociety, there have been significant difficulties in determining\\nwho should be held responsible for the results of AI-enhanced\\nacts. Provisions for processes that would enable tracing\\nresponsibility in a wide range of stakeholders, including\\nfarmers, custodians, and machines, must be in place. Some\\napproaches suggest an AI responsibility chain, which\\nseparates the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder\\nduring the development and deployment process to prevent\\nover-reliance on one individual [97].\\nPrivacy and Security Standards are especially critical\\nwhen addressing Agentic AI, which generally requires\\noperating on susceptible data. There should be guidelines\\nprescribing how data is managed, secured or anonymized\\nto meet user privacy. This includes baseline restrictions on\\nprocessing, such as the use of differential privacy and secure\\naccess to databases, which allow for reducing possibilities\\nfor breaches or abuse of the data. Furthermore, appropriate\\nmeasures should be employed to safeguard the security\\nof Agentic AI, especially in smart cities and autonomous\\nvehicles where such AI systems are exposed to potential\\ncyber threats and can be a danger to the public.\\nTo concretize these principles, several regulating author-\\nities and industry associations have suggested using ethical\\nguidelines and frameworks aimed at the responsible use of\\nartificial intelligence. In particular, some of the core material\\nfor the legal issues of privacy and other user rights are con-\\ntained in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed\\nby the European Union and the General Data Protection\\nRegulation. Similarly, the IEEE and the Partnership on AI\\norganizations have also formulated some behavioral artificial\\nintelligence ethics addressing responsibility, fairness, and\\nopenness issues. Although these guidelines have no universal\\napplication, effective international government authority has\\nbeen advocated to coordinate the interaction between AI\\npolicies and standards from different countries.\\nA further development concerning the issue is establishing\\nan internationally operating AI coordinating entity or a\\nconsortium like in Europe that could promote the estab-\\nlishment of AI standards and global adherence to ethical\\nprinciples. This organization would create an objective to\\nstandardize AI regulations so that ethical norms and safety\\nrequirements will invariably be provided across countries and\\nindustries. Moreover, it necessitates research on adaptive\\nregulatory regimes [98] that are responsive to technological\\ndevelopments.\\nTable 14 summarizes the primary components of ethical\\nframeworks and global standards for Agentic AI, outlining\\nessential areas for responsible and safe AI governance.\\nI. THEORETICAL ADVANCES IN AI AGENCY\\nAI systems with the potential for intelligent action still need\\ntheoretical development regarding number and complexity\\nin understanding agency, self-organization, and decision-\\nmaking processes.

In a larger perspective, however,\\nsome theoretical extensions of the issues, like multi-agent\\ncoordination, meta-goal achievement, active persistence, and\\nplanner controlling with ethical consideration, assist the AI\\nmodels in behaving appropriately in different environments.\\nMulti-agent coordination is an example of such a class\\nof theories, and it is concerned with allowing AI agents\\nto engage, communicate, and collaborate in environments\\nthat contain multiple autonomous entities. In particular,\\npractical applications multi-agent coordination is crucial for\\napplications in collaborative robotics, decentralized systems,\\nand smart city architecture. This domain examines how\\nagents learn to pursue their separate aims while achieving\\nmutual goals or seeking to work cooperatively, utilizing\\nmaterials from game theory, reinforcement learning, and\\ncommunication theory. Developments in this domain will\\nallow Agentic AI to carry out interdependent complex tasks\\nwhere agents must cooperate and compete.\\nLong-term goal management is decisive and is char-\\nacterized as having advanced agentic capabilities. There\\nare deeply ingrained limitations concerning timelines with\\ncurrent AI systems. Current AIs tend to optimize for shorter\\ntimelines, thus losing the capacity to strategize, forecast\\ntrends, and distinguish between sub-objectives. Theoretical\\nwork addresses the practical challenges of enabling AIs to\\nset and pursue long-range goals as conditions change and\\nconstraints emerge. Hierarchical reinforcement learning and\\ntemporal reasoning are two measures that have promise as\\nthey allow AI systems to decompose high-level goals into\\nsub-tasks, which take the system toward the overall end state\\nthrough predetermined objectives.\\nAgents’ ability to wait for a reward and workers’ pursuit\\non their own define two self-rewarding procedures that\\nemerge towards the creation of agentic AI; both procedures in\\ndomination with zero hit or standalone provide enough basis\\nto move forward without external incentives or directives.\\nAn emerging field of research in self-directed strategy relies\\non developing agents that can explore, learn, and adapt\\nbased solely on their curiosity about their environment. This\\nwould be important in cases where the information space is\\nuncertain or where the goal is not defined and other variables\\nare likely to change within the domain of the goal. Further\\ndevelopment in the theory of self-rewarding will enhance AI\\nagents’ abilities to be goal-oriented and directed by a flexible\\nstrategy while dealing with complex problems caused by a\\nlack of structure.\\nMoral reasoning and ethical decision-making are gain-\\ning acceptance in the field of advanced AI agency [99],\\nparticularly now that AI is increasingly used for sensitive and\\nhigh-risk tasks. Research on moral reasoning seeks to offer a\\nbasis for ethical deliberations in autonomous systems so that\\nAgentic AI can purposefully choose actions with thought of\\ntheir effects and values. In this context, integrating ethics,\\nphilosophy, and psychology into AI is an overarching aim\\nif ethical AI systems should be created. Codifying moral\\nreasoning in AI will be necessary for health, law and order,\\nand autonomous automobiles, the decision of which can be\\ninfluential to society.\\nA few of the areas of theoretical research that need a\\nmention are self-awareness and meta-cognition [100] in\\nAI which include building systems that understand their\\nactions, abilities, or limitations as self-referential knowledge.\\nAll the AI that are self-aware will be able to self-evaluate\\nwhether they have performed their tasks optimally, what can\\nbe improved, and what actions to take when there are failures\\nor poor performance.
