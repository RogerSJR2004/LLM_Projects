📚 RAG & LLMs Portfolio
Welcome to my RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LLMs repository — a consolidated showcase of applied research, prototypes, and production-grade experiments using state-of-the-art Large Language Models, LangChain, and LangGraph.

This work is part of my journey as an AI & Data Science engineer, where I explore how RAG-powered systems can solve real-world problems in domains like finance, productivity, automation, and knowledge workflows.

🔍 Overview
This repository includes projects built around:

✅ LangChain for building modular RAG pipelines

✅ LangGraph for orchestrating multi-step retrieval and generation workflows

✅ RAG Frameworks for scalable question-answering and intelligent search

✅ Generative AI applications for text, code, and domain-specific insights

Each project emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and real-world impact.
