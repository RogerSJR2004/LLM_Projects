# LLMs & AI Agents Portfolio

Welcome to my **LLMs and AI Agents** repository ‚Äî a consolidated showcase of applied research, experiments, and production-grade prototypes using state-of-the-art **Large Language Models**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Autonomous AI Agents**.

This work is part of my journey as an AI & Data Science engineer, where I explore how intelligent systems can solve real-world problems across domains like finance, productivity, automation, and knowledge management.

## üîç Overview

This repository includes projects built around:

- ‚úÖ **LangChain** for building modular LLM pipelines
- ‚úÖ **LangGraph** for multi-agent workflows and stateful reasoning
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous Agents** using tools, memory, and planning strategies
- ‚úÖ **Generative AI** applications for text, code, and data generation

Each project emphasizes **clarity, reproducibility**, and **real-world applicability**.
